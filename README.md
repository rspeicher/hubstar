# HubStar

**HubStar** is the missing "star" feature for GitHub repositories. You can
already star Gists, so why not repositories?

## How does it work?

After signing in to HubStar with your GitHub account and installing a browser
extension, you'll notice a new section next to the fork and watch sections on
any GitHub repository page:

The new **star icon** works just like the fork and watch icons you're used to
using on GitHub. Click the star to remember it for later, click it again to
stop.

## Security & Privacy

On GitHub repository pages, the HubStar browser extension makes a `GET` request
to HubStar's servers, passing along the URL of the currently viewed repository.
It will only do this on **public** repositories. No information regarding
private repositories is ever sent to external servers, or even read by the
extension.

Further, the source for the entire site, including the browser extensions, is
available on GitHub.
